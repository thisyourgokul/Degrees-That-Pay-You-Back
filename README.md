# Degrees-That-Pay-You-Back
Explore the salary potential of college majors with a k-means cluster analysis.


Project Description:

Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help us pay the bills? Think we are set with an Engineering degree? Whether we are in school or navigating the postgrad world, this project will guide us in exploring the short- and long-term financial implications of this major decision. After doing some data clean up, we will compare the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means cluster analysis, and visualize the results.
This project assumes familiarity with standard tidyverse tools for R. While not required, it would also be helpful to have a prior understanding of clustering unsupervised data with k-means.
The dataset used in this project is by the Wall Street Journal.


Project Tasks:

1. Which college majors will pay the bills?
2. Currency and strings and percents, oh my!
3. The elbow method
4. The silhouette method
5. The gap statistic method
6. K-means algorithm
7. Visualizing the clusters
8. A deeper dive into the clusters
9. The liberal arts cluster
10. The goldilocks cluster
11. The over achiever cluster
12. Every major's wonderful
