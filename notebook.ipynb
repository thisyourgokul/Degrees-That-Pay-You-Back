Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects. Your first paycheck right out of college might say a lot about your salary potential by mid-career. Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this <em>major</em> decision.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we'll be using data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html?mod=article_inline\">here</a> by the Wall Street Journal for their article <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271\">Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay</a>.
